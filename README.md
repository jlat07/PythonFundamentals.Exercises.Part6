## Exercise 1

Open the program called *tuple_utils.py*

* For each function, remove the line containing the pass statement and implement the functionality described in the docstrings.
* Run the unit tests to validate that the implementation passes unit tests.

```
python3 -m unittest test_tuple_utils.py
```

## Exercise 2

Open the program called *temperature_utils.py*

* For each function, remove the line containing the pass statement and implement the functionality described in the docstrings.
* Run the unit tests to validate that the implementation passes unit tests.

```
python3 -m unittest test_temperature_utils.py
```

## Exercise 3 

Create a program called *temperature_utils_v2.py*

* Extend the functionality from exercise 2 to allow for conversion using Kelvin units.
* Be sure to include tests for the new functionality.
